    Setup:
        Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

        .. code-block:: bash

            pip install -U langchain-core pydantic

    Instantiate:

        .. code-block:: python

            from your_module import RadiologyReportGeneratorTool

            tool = RadiologyReportGeneratorTool()

    Invoke directly with args:

        .. code-block:: python

            tool.invoke({'image_path': '/path/to/image.jpg'})

        .. code-block:: python

            'Radiology report for image: /path/to/image.jpg, heart is normal, lungs have pneumonia.'  # Placeholder output
